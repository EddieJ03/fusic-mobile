# Fusic

A mobile application that allows you to view other people's top artists & songs and chat with them!

### Home Screen
The Home Screen features a stack of cards (like Tinder). On each card, you can see some of this person's top artists and songs. You can swipe right if you feel like you share similar musical interests with this individual. Otherwise, swipe left. If both of you swipe right on each other, this person will be added to your friend's list (and you will be added to theirs).
